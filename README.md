# Real-Time Chat with Firebase
 <!-- Optional: Add a nice banner image to an assets folder -->

A modern, real-time chat application built on the Firebase platform. This project aims to create a unified communication ecosystem that eliminates the need for users to choose between powerful features and robust privacy.

## ‚ú® Project Vision

Our mission is to solve the **Digital Communication Paradox**. Users today are forced to juggle multiple apps: one for secure messaging, another for large communities, and a third for work. This project creates a single, integrated platform that provides both state-of-the-art **End-to-End Encryption** for private conversations and a rich, **feature-packed environment** for communities, all within one intuitive application.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   A Firebase project. You can create one for free at the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mrkk292006/Real-Time-Chat-with-Firebase.git
    cd Real-Time-Chat-with-Firebase
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Firebase CLI:**
    ```sh
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

4.  **Log in to Firebase:**
    ```sh
    firebase login
    ```

5.  **Connect to your Firebase project:**
    Follow the on-screen prompts to associate this local project with your Firebase project.
    ```sh
    firebase use --add
    ```

6.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
    *   Add your Firebase project configuration keys to this file. You can find these in your Firebase project settings under "Your apps" > "SDK setup and configuration".
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    ```

7.  **Run the Firebase Emulators:**
    For a complete offline development experience, we use the Firebase Local Emulator Suite.
    ```sh
    firebase emulators:start
    ```
    This will start local emulators for Auth, Firestore, and Functions.

8.  **Run the development server:**
    Open a new terminal window and run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
